///
/// Sun Clock
///
/// Draws the Actual Sun/Moon/Earth/Stars Clock
///
/// A general explanation is as follows
///
/// Draws in order
/// - Fixed star background (rotating over time, for motion effect)
///
/// - Star Simulation
///   - Matrix math for projecting and transforming to "time space"
///     and screen space
///   - Batched by Z distance to set size/color and draw with drawPoints()
///     to reduce draw calls
///
/// - Sun
///   - "Hour Hand".
///   - First draws a circle (Base Layer) in white
///   - Drawn in layers (4 images)
///   - The layers have varying blend modes (Multiply/Plus/SoftLight)
///     - Multiply to emulate sunspots
///     - Plus/Softlight to emulate light/glowing
///   - Layers rotate slowly in varying directions
///   - Each layer is drawn twice, once flipped and rotated in
///     opposite direction
///   - The effective 8 layers do a Perlin compose a perlin noise that
///     looks a lot like the sun.
///
/// - Earth
///   - "Minute Hand"
///   - Rotates around the center of the screen once per hour.
///   - Shadow layer is drawn over the earth, opposite the sun
///
/// - Moon
///   - "Seconds Hand"
///   - Rotates around earth once a minute
///   - Shadow layer is drawn over the moon, opposite the sun
///
/// Notes: This is graphics/math heavy, custom code to create the scene
