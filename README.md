Flutter Clock

A clock for the flutter clock challenge featuring the following

- A not physically accurate space simulation
- Sun, Earth and Moon
- A digital clock in the top-left
- "Dark" and "Light" themes. The sun is much bigger in the Light Theme.

How it works

Sun = Hour hand
Earth = Minute Hand
Moon = Seconds hand

Sun and Earth rotate the screen. Moon rotates the earth.
